Tag Aware Sharding
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For sharded clusters, MongoDB makes it possible to associate specific
ranges of a :term:`shard key` with a specific :term:`shard` or subset
of shards. This association dictates the policy of the cluster
balancer process as it balances the :term:`chunks <chunk>` around the
cluster. This capability enables the following deployment patterns:

- isolating a specific subset of data on specific set of shards.

- controlling the balancing policy so that, in a geographically
  distributed cluster, the most relevant portions of the data set
  reside on the shards with the greatest proximity to the application
  servers.

This document describes the behavior, operation, and use of tag aware
sharding in MongoDB deployments.

.. note::

   Shard key range tags are entirely distinct from :ref:`replica set member
   tags <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`.

:term:`Hash-based sharding <hashed shard key>` does not support
tag-aware sharding.

Behavior and Operations
-----------------------

Tags in a sharded cluster are pieces of metadata that dictate the
policy and behavior of the cluster :term:`balancer`. Using
tags, you may associate individual shards in a cluster with one or
more tags. Then, you can assign this tag string to a range
of :term:`shard key` values for a sharded collection. When migrating a
chunk, the balancer will select a destination shard based on the
configured tag ranges.

Since the interval between the lower bound and the upper bound of a chunk may
span more than one tag range, the balancer only checks whether the *lower bound* 
of the chunk falls within a given tag range, and ignores the upper bound of
the chunk.  This ensures that there is always a single well-defined target shard
for any chunk that is about to be migrated.

.. example::

   Given a sharded collection with two configured tag ranges, such
   that:

   - :term:`Shard key` values between ``100`` and ``200`` have tags to
     direct corresponding chunks to shards tagged ``NYC``.

   - Shard Key values between ``200`` and ``300`` have tags to direct
     corresponding chunks to shards tagged ``SFO``.

   In this cluster, the balancer will migrate a chunk with shard key
   values ranging between ``150`` and ``220`` to a shard tagged
   ``NYC``, since ``150`` falls within the range ``100..200``.

After configuring tags on the shards and ranges of the shard key, the
cluster may take some time to reach the proper distribution of data,
depending on the division of chunks (i.e. splits) and the current
distribution of data in the cluster. Once configured, the balancer
will respect tag ranges during future :ref:`balancing rounds
<sharding-internals-balancing>`.
